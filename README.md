In recreational mathematics, a Harshad number in a given number base, is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base. Harshad numbers in base n are also known as n-Harshad numbers. Harshad numbers were defined by D. R. Kaprekar, a mathematician from India. The word "Harshad" comes from the Sanskrit harṣa (joy) + da (give), meaning joy-giver. 

Stated mathematically, let $X$ be a positive integer with $m$ digits when written in base $n$, and let the digits be $a_i (i = 0, 1, ..., m − 1)$. (It follows that $a_i$ must be either zero or a positive integer up to $n − 1$.) $X$ can be expressed as

$$
X=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i n^i.
$$

If there exists an integer $A$ such that the following holds, then $X$ is a Harshad number in base $n$:

$$
X=A\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i.
$$

A number which is a Harshad number in any number base is called an all-Harshad number. There are only four all-Harshad numbers: 1, 2, 4, and 6 (The number 12 is a Harshad number in all bases except octal).
